- How to optimize transformation of binary classifiers into multi-class
classifiers
  - review plus ideas for improvement

- Can we optimize the error in a balloon kernel-density estimate using
 estimates of bias and mean square error?

- Improved sparse matrix calculator (lists, user functions, control
  structures)

- Scientific database/programming language based on non-normalized relations

- Derive ozone isolines from GOME data and compare with contour advection
  simulations

- Quantify errors in PC proxy and use to select parameters

- Understanding chaotic mixing: relation to diffusion and diffusivity; tracer
  correlation

- Wave scattering from Gaspard-Rice system

- Improve software:
  - more testing: unit tests where applicable, black box tests elsewhere
  - remove and replace components duplicated by STL
  - documentation especially friendly tutorials and user guides
