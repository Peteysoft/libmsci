	ftp.strath.ac.uk  (130.159.248.24)

2.   Login as 'anonymous' and use your email name as password. 

3.   Change directory to Stams/statlog

4.   The datasets are in the Stams/statlog directory.  
    
     Large datasets have three files associated with them.:
            a training dataset *.tra
            a test dataset     *.tes
            documentation      *.doc  
     For example, the DNA dataset has the three files
            dna.tra     dna.tes     dna.doc
     It is necessary to copy all three files.
 
     The smaller datasets have only two datasets associated:
            the dataset        *
            documentation      *.doc
     For example, the heart dataset, has the two files
            heart      heart.doc
            
5.   Evaluation Assistant files are in the directory  Stams/statlog/ea
     and associated man pages in directory      Stams/statlog/ea/eaman
                
6.   FORTRAN programs for statistical discrimination (linear, logistic
     and quadratic) are in the directory        Stams/statlog/programs 
     
7.   A brief guide to the use of Evaluation Assistant and the FORTRAN
     programs is contained in the LaTex file   Stams/statlog/guide.tex
