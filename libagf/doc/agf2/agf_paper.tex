\section*{Acknowledgements}
Thank you very much to my colleaques from the IUP, University of
Bremen for their continued support and encouragement of this work,
in particular Stefan Buehler, Georg Heygster and Oliver Lemke.  
Thanks to Christian Melsheimer for his very valued comments on the first draft.
Thanks especially to the former PEP (Postgraduate program in
Environmental Physics) team, Stefanie Buehler, Prof. JÃ¶rn
Bleck-Neuhaus, Christine Schiwek and Barbara Kosak, without whom
I would not have been able to complete my master's degree, from
which this paper is derived.
