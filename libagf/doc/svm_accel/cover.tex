\opening{Dear Kevin Murphy and Bernhard Sch\"olkopf:}

I am submitting the paper entitled, ``Accelerating Kernel Classifiers Through
Borders Mapping,'' for consideration for publication in the Journal of
Machine Learning Research. The paper uses a simple piecewise linear classifier
to speed up kernel-based classifiers. This is tested on 17 different datasets
and is successful on 9 of those. The paper is original, it is entirely my own work
and has not been submitted to any other journal.

My suggestions for action editors are: Andreas Christmann, Ingo Steinward and
Isabelle Guyon.

\closing{Kind regards,}

\end{letter}
