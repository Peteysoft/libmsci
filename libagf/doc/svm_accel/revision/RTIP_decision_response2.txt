In addition to those discussed below, I have made minor changes to the manuscript to improve clarity, accuracy and flow.

No, the software is not effective for all cases. We take some pains to describe those types of problems for which it is most likely to be effective.

We have used Liblinear for all of the linear classifications. Some were trained with dual and some with the primal problem, depending upon which was more accurate. There is even a short section, Section 3.1, describing the Liblinear library. Since the theory section describes both linear classifiers and SVMs together in the same subsection, we have added the following:
"Even though different software is used for each, we describe support vector machines (SVMs) and linear classifiers in the same section since a linear classifier is just a restricted version of a SVM."


> Reviewer #4: I am satisfied with the author's response.

Thank you.
