The number of possible methods of generalizing binary classification to 
multi-class classification increases exponentially with the number of class labels.
Often, the best method of doing so will be highly problem dependent.
Here we present classification software in which the partitioning of multi-
class classification problems into binary classification problems is
specified using a recursive control language.
