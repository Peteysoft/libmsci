Thank you for submitting your article "Solving the multi-class using orthogonal coding matrices". After carefully reading your manuscript, I have decided to reject the article at this stage without seeking external reviewers. The main reasons are as follows:

1/ The article considers the problem of multiclass classification, a mature problem that has generated a lot of literature, and many competing methods have been proposed. In this respect, the empirical evaluation appears below the standards of JMLR, with a comparison to a single, 13-year old, alternative method (Wu et al., 2014). Additionally, the experiments do not demonstrate any statistically significant improvement compared to this existing methods.

- Except most methods solve for the class only, not the probabilities. As I
  hope I've made clear, the major goal of the paper was to solve for the
  probabilities in addition to the most likely class. Wu et al is the only
  method I know of that solves for all of the probabilitiesi with all of the
  constraints satisfied. Moreover, how is the age of the method relevant? 
  Clearly it works and it works well  so the time it was invented seems to me 
  immaterial.

- The lack of "negative results" has been found to be a problem in the medical
  literature for a number of reasons. I believe it is a problem in other
  fields as well. For example, if someone invents a method, yet it has been 
  tested before and found lacking, having the results published in the 
  literature saves them from wasting their time. And as I point out in the 
  paper, the ideas may be useful for creating methods 
  that do generate significant improvements to those existing. The ideas may
  be useful in other contexts as well.

2/ The presentation and mathematical accuracy appear to be lacking. The discussion of background literature in the introduction is very limited (for example, Wu et al. is only 
introduced in Section 4). Many notations are not defined. For example 
* a without an arrow page 2
* m below equation (5) page 2
* p with arrow appears both as the solution of the optimization problem and in the objective function in Eq (3) page 2
* N and N' page 4

- Point 1: if you mean in Section 1, this is an error, but should be clear 
  from the context. In Section 2, a is clearly defined as an element of the 
  matrix A.
- Point 2: "We wish to design a set of m binary classifiers, each of which
  return a decision function." First sentence, Section 2.
- Point 3: this is an error; thanks for spotting that.
- Point 4: a definition is not necessary since the meaning is chiefly important
  within the context of the equation, e.g. Equations (7) and (8) need to be 
  tested for different values of N'.

The correctness of Eq. (6) is questionable. It clearly cannot be true in general. It is also unclear what is meant by the title of section 4: "validating the probabilities".

- "Validating the probabilities": how do we know if probability estimates are
  accurate or not? Either we need prior estimates whose validity is known, or
  we need some other relation that must be satisfied. Check the derivation in
  Mills 2009, Section 4.2, Equations (21) and (22). You are correct, it's not 
  true in general: the samples must be distributed according to the prior
  probability, P(x), as the derivation should make clear.
