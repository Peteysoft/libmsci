Probability estimates are desirable in statistical classification
both for gauging the accuracy of 
a classification result and for calibration.
Here we describe a method of solving for the conditional probabilities
in multi-class classification using orthogonal error correcting codes.
The method is tested on six different datasets using support
vector machines and compares favorably
with an existing technique based on the one-versus-one
multi-class method.
Probabilities are validated based on the cumulative sum of a boolean evaluation
of the correctness of each classification result divided by the estimated
probability.
Probability estimation using orthogonal coding is simple and efficient and has the 
potential for faster classification results than the one-versus-one method.
%Research is needed to find efficient methods of generating orthogonal coding
%matrices for problems with a large number of classes.
