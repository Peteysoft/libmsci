We describe a method of solving for the conditional probabilities
in multi-class classification using orthogonal error-correcting codes.
The method is tested on six different datasets using support
vector machines as the binary classifiers and both the classification results as well as the
probability estimates are found to be more accurate than using random coding
matrices, as predicted by recent literature.
Probability estimates are desirable in statistical classification
both for gauging the accuracy of 
a classification result and for calibration.
Probability estimation using orthogonal codes is simple and elegant
making it faster than the more general constrained optimization solutions
required for arbitrary codes.
%Research is needed to find efficient methods of generating orthogonal coding
%matrices for problems with a large number of classes.
