We describe a method of solving for the conditional probabilities
in multi-class classification
using orthogonal error correcting codes.
Probabilities are useful both for gauging the accuracy of a classification
result when its true value is unknown and for recalibration.
The method is tested on six different datasets using support
vector machines and shown
to be roughly as accurate as another method based on the one-versus-one
multi-class method.
Probabilities are validated based on the cumulative sum of a boolean evaluation
of the correctness of each classification result divided by the estimated
probability.
Classification using orthogonal coding is simple and efficient and has the 
potential for faster classification results than the one-versus-one method.
%Research is needed to find efficient methods of generating orthogonal coding
%matrices for problems with a large number of classes.
