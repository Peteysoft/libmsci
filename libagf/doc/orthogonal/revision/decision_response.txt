Comments to the author (if any):
Reviewer #2: The paper addresses interesting topic, namely Solving for multi-class using orthogonal coding matrices. It is claimed that authors proposed method with orthogonal coding matrices.
Abstract does not comprise adequately the content of the manuscript. Obtained numerical results must be given in the abstract. This section must be rewritten by the authors.

R: The abstract has been rewritten. I have tried to include numerical values where such might be useful.

Introduction where theoretical background must be provided is very weak.
Literature review should significantly be improved.

R: The introduction has been revised and expanded with more detail added to the background and to the description of ECCs.

The level of English is moderate for the academic paper. However, it requires some effort to understand. There are a few minor grammar mistakes. However, the written texture should be improved.

R: I have proofread the manuscript and made changes where necessary to improve clarity, accuracy, and grammar.

Proposed Method and given tables must be explained in detailed ways.

R: Tables have been revised with a longer caption.

Additional Performance Analysis parameters and experimental results must be added the presented paper.

R: A much more detailed comparison has been completed including four more methods and two other binary classifiers.

Conclusion section can be extended by giving additional information regarding the paper.
Future works regarding the paper can be given in detailed ways.

R: The conclusion section has been expanded with future work included.

References section should be revised to comply with the journal format. Additional references can be added.

R: The reference style was that supplied with the Latex package. The other two formats are name-year citation styles. I have managed to change it to an unsorted style as required by the journal but the year still appears in the wrong place.

This paper can be published after major revision.
