\begin{itemize}

 \item An orthogonal coding matrix is optimal for error-correcting codes
	 when solving for multi-class from binary.

 \item An orthogonal coding matrix greatly simplifies the calculation of
	conditional probabilities.

 \item Orthogonal coding matrices were tested on six different datasets and
	 shown to be competitive with an existing technique.

 \item Probabilities were validated based on a theorem derived from Bayes
	 theorem and the definition of probability.

 \item Orthogonal coding matrices are simple and elegant and have the 
	 potential for efficient multi-class classification.
