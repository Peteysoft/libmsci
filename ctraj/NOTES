List of deprecated or soon-to-be deprecated files:

* coeffs.h
* model1.cc			-- replaced by ctraj_model
* model2.cc
* model2L.cc
* contour1.cc			-- replaced by ctraj_contour
* contour2.cc
* contour3.cc			-- replaced by "space-filling experiment"
* tracer3_step1.cc		-- replaced by ctraj_tracer
* tracer4_matout.cc
* tracer5.cc
* tracerLL.cc
traj_int_obj.h			-- replaced by ctraj_vfield_*
traj_int_obj.cc
* traj_int_global_obj.h
* traj_int_global_obj.cc
tcoord_defs.h			-- replaced by az_eq_t, but still used by a couple of programs
tcoord_defs.cc
* boundary_list.h			-- replaced by ctraj_boundary_list
* boundary_list.cc
* boundary_list_g.h		-- replaced by ctraj_boundary_list
* boundary_list_g.cc
boundary_swap.h			-- "swapped" contour: might be useful for contour with surgery
boundary_swap.cc
* bev2bev2.cc			-- goes with contour3: junk
ncep_surf_to_vfield.cc		-- what exactly was this meant for? really should move beyond such crude garbage
* t4_matout_step2.pro		-- don't have access to IDL anymore :-(
* tcoord_vector.h			-- attempt to add pointless abstraction...
* write_latitude_contour.cc	-- does the same thing as c0, but different file format

* starred files have been removed: others are kept either because the are used by other projects (isoline retrieval) or they may be useful for future projects

   -----

* UNFINISHED PROJECT *

These files are attempts to update old files to conform to the new, more general re-factor:

ctraj_tracer_anal.h		-- replaces tracer_anal
ctraj_tracer_anal.cc
fieldtran.h			-- updates lla2aeb and extract_field
fieldtran.cc
generate_tracer_map.cc		-- encapsulates generalized tracer advection

They should either be finished promptly or discarded...

* UNFINISHED PROJECT *

Binning experiment (I can make this work, I know I can!!):

gbin_base.h
gbin_base.cc
gbin_ll.h
gbin_ll.cc
gbin_s.h
gbin_s.cc
lonlat_binsub.h
lonlat_binsub.cc
test_global_binning.cc		-- (doesn't speed things up in the slightest!)

   -----

* UNFINISHED PROJECT *

Contour surgery (one of these days I'll finish it...):

surgery_element.h
surgery_element.cc
surgery_obj.h
surgery_obj.cc

   -----

I am flagging potentially problematic code that should be updated
with the following comment:

//*FLAG*

This will include:
- constants or enumerates define using the #define macro
- fixed-length arrays and other data structures
