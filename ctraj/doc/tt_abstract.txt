We review matrix methods as applied to tracer transport.
Because tracer transport is linear, matrix methods are an ideal
fit for the problem.
A gridded, Eulerian tracer simulation can be approximated
as a system of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
The first-order stretching and deformation of Lagrangian space 
can also be calculated using a system of linear ODEs.
Solutions to these equations are reviewed
as well as special properties.
Using matrices to model tracer transport can also help understand and
improve the stability of numerical solutions.
Detailed derivations are included.
