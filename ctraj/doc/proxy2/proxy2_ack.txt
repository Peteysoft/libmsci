Thanks to the National Center for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research for the reanalysis data used in the simulations.
Thanks also to World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center and Environment Canada for ozone sonde data.
And thanks especially to my former colleagues at the Naval Research Laboratory for POAM III ozone data.

Contour maps were created with Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) while scatter plots
and historgrams were done in Open Office.
