Title: Principal Component Proxy Tracer Analysis
Atmospheric Environment

Dear Dr Mills,

I now have two referee reports (see below) for this manuscript. One favors publication and the other is very critical, especially in the clarity and presentation. In particular, both reviewers pointed out that there are important information missing and reframing and rewriting of the work are needed. Based on their evaluations, I have decided to reject the present work for publication in Atmospheric Environment. However, you may consider submitting the work to us again as a new submission, in the form of a technical note, if you have incorporated the comments raised properly into the revised manuscript.

I am sorry to disappoint you in this instance, but hope that it will not prevent you from considering Atmospheric Environment a suitable place to publish your work in the future.

Yours sincerely,

Reviewers' comments:
Reviewer #1:
This paper describes a newly developed method called principal component proxy tracer analysis for dynamical reconstruction of long-lived tracers. The ideal of the method is novel, and the paper can be accepted after a revision.

Specific comments:
1) Introduction: The author mentioned the method developed by Randall et al.(2002), and then presented the new method. However, the author should address that the advantage of the new method, comparing with the traditional method. It can help the reader understand that why the new method should be used.

2) Page 9, line 103: "The Lyapunov spectrum can help us select the number of singular vectors as it shows how many remain significant at a given lead time-see Figure 2." Please describe more detailed about the selection of the number of singular vectors. Because the number selection is very important for this method.

3) Page 11, line 142: "The number of PCs required will be related in part to the lead time, as discussed in Section 5, with shorter lead times requiring more PCs." Please provide a criterion for PCs selection, such as the PCs with the eigenvalue greater than a certain value?

4) The discussion and conclusion should be enhanced.





Reviewer #2:
The manuscript is at the frontier scope of the atmospheric environment.

The manuscript can be interesting for the audience of atmospheric environment but not in current version.

Thus, my opinion is that the manuscript must be rejected. The presentation is very confused and the aim and the novelty of the manuscript are not clearly presented.

A suggestion for the author is to create a more detailed manuscript reformulating all sections of the manuscript. All of them need to be written in more detail.

-> Introduction and Discussion and Conclusions: more accurate works on shorter time scales,
potentially more degrees of freedom, more parameters to tune

2) Page 9, line 103: "The Lyapunov spectrum can help us select the number of singular vectors as it shows how many remain significant at a given lead time-see Figure 2." Please describe more detailed about the selection of the number of singular vectors. Because the number selection is very important for this method.

-> (need to flesh that out more) Error analysis and Discussion and
Conclusions: more PCs = more accurate but less stable, less PCs=less accurate
but more stable

3) Page 11, line 142: "The number of PCs required will be related in part to the lead time, as discussed in Section 5, with shorter lead times requiring more PCs." Please provide a criterion for PCs selection, such as the PCs with the eigenvalue greater than a certain value?

Reviewer #2:
The manuscript is at the frontier scope of the atmospheric environment.

-> (so why not say publish... ?)

The manuscript can be interesting for the audience of atmospheric environment but not in current version.

Thus, my opinion is that the manuscript must be rejected. The presentation is very confused and the aim and the novelty of the manuscript are not clearly presented.

-> presentation, especially the theoretical development has been improved

A suggestion for the author is to create a more detailed manuscript reformulating all sections of the manuscript. All of them need to be written in more detail. 

-> the paper has been expanded and fleshed out
