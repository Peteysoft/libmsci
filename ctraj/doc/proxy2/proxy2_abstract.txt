We introduce a powerful method for dynamical reconstruction of long-lived
tracers such as ozone called principal component proxy tracer analysis.  
It works by correlating the largest principal components of a matrix
representation of the transport dynamics with a series of sparse measurements. 
The Lyapunov spectrum was measured and used to quantify the lifetime of each principal component. 
The method was tested on the 500 K isentropic surface with ozone measurements from the Polar Aerosol and Ozone Measurement (POAM) III satellite instrument
during October and November 1998 and compared with the older proxy tracer method
which works by correlating measurements with a single other tracer or proxy. 
Using a 60 day integration time and five (5) principal components, cross
validation of globally reconstructed ozone and comparison with ozone sondes returned root-mean-square errors of 0.16 ppmv and 0.36 ppmv, respectively.
This compares favourably with the classic proxy tracer method in which a passive
tracer equivalent latitude field was used for the proxy and 
which returned RMS errors of 0.30 ppmv and 0.59 ppmv for cross-validation
and sonde validation respectively.
The method seems especially effective for shorter lived tracers and was far
more accurate than the classic method at predicting ozone concentration in the
Southern hemisphere at the end of winter.
