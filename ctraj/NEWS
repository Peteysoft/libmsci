Changes between r187 and r252

- Runge-Kutta integration routines are now threadsafe

- added file conversion utility that downloads ECMWF data directly from the
  ECMWF website and writes it to .ds ("dataset") files.  Like the author of 
  this software, it isn't working yet.

- help screens now print to stdout instead of stderr if you use the -? switch

- experimented with binning routines to improve the efficiency of some codes
  (it didn't work)

- added executables for estimating the box-counting dimension of an advected
  contour in three different ways and for calculating the contour length

- ridiculous "space-filling" experiment designed to eat your computer 

- plotting utilities have been refined and are now copied to the 'bin' 
  directory during installation

- proper underscoring in Fortran subroutine names

Changes between revisions 252 and 305

- the three main programs for trajectory integration, contour advection and
  tracer advection, have been completely refactored to make them 
  general as well as extensible.  They have been renamed to: ctraj_model, 
  ctraj_contour and ctraj_tracer.

- the new advection models now support analytic velocity fields.  These must
  be compiled separately and then dynamically linked.

- vdata2ds: a utility for converting velocity fields in ASCII format to the 
  native binary format has been added.  It has been validated with two scripts
  that convert NCEP (ncep2ds.sh) and ECMWF data (see below).

- ecmwf2ds.sh: a script for downloading and converting ECMWF data has also 
  been added.  It has been tested and appears to work.

- extract_ncep_field is a utility for extracting a single (2D) NCEP field and
  printing it to standard out
